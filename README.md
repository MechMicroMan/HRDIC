# HRDIC

Some Python functions to analyse HRDIC data from Davis. The hrdic folder contains a notebook and a python module.

- At the moment, the notebook contains all functions and examples.

- The python module contains the same functions but in a more reusable form. 

To analyse you data, you can can either modify your own version of the notebook, or import the HRDIC_analysis.py module at the start of a new notebook. I will upload an example notebook doing just this when I get a chance._

The data directory contains some HRDIC data. It's a 3x3 mosaic, at three strain levels. I will provide more details about this dataset later.
