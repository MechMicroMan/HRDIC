# HRDIC

Some Python functions to analyse HRDIC data from Davis.

At the moment, the notebook contains all functions and examples.

The python module contains the same functions but in a more reusable form. 

To analyse you data, you can can either modify your own version of the notebook, or import the HRDIC_analysis.py module at the start of a new notebook. I will upload an example notebook doing just this when I get a chance._
